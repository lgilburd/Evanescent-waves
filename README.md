# Evanescent-waves
A simple fit of evanescent waves

During my phd research I experimentally obtained images, as shown below. On the image one can see a quickly decaying wave. A decaying wave can be described by the following equation: 


This simple python code can be used to fit the experimental data to get the unknown parameters.
